## sjmm_util

A collection of misc functions developed to make certain data analysis, plotting, and fitting tasks easier.

## modules:

- `line_utils`: codes for analyzing millimeter lines, converting frequencies, etc.
- `scuba2_utils`: codes for working with reduced, matched-filtered SCUBA-2 data. Credit to Li-Yen Hsu for the original versions, which I've adapted.
- `config`: my (evolving) personal config / matplotlib style sheet, etc.
- `catalog`: tools for working with catalogs of galaxies, coordinates, tables, etc.
- `datatools`: tools for analyzing arrays, smoothing, getting image footprints, etc.
- `mosfire`: tools for preparing masks for the [MOSFIRE](https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/mosfire/home.html) spectrograph on the Keck I telescope.

These are mainly for my own use, but if you find them useful, feel free to leave a comment on the Github page. Some of them are accessible in their own repositories (e.g., scuba2), since I've moved away from a single utility package over time. But I try to keep everything updated for consistency.
