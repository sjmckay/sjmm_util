## sjmm_util

A collection of misc functions developed to make certain data analysis, plotting, and fitting tasks easier.

## modules:
--------
- line_utils: codes for analyzing millimeter lines, converting frequencies, etc.
- scuba2_utils: codes for working with reduced, matched-filtered SCUBA-2 data. Credit to Li-Yen Hsu for the original versions, which I've adapted.
- config: my (evolving) personal config / matplotlib style sheet, etc.
- general_utils: everything else!

These are mainly for my own use, but if you find them useful, feel free to leave a comment on the Github page.
